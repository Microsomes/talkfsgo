This helps to camouflage the sloth, allowing it to blend into its arboreal habitat and protecting it from predators.",

Seen by some as a miracle, the shrine to Central America's first Saint, Saint Peter of Joseph Betancur, survived. The church was partially reconstructed in the 1960s, and aspects of its original baroque facade are visible, though much still lies in ruin. Today, many people visit the tomb of St. Peter to ask him for favors and miracles.",
