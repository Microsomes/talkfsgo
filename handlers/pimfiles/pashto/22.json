Guests could enjoy a view of the lake or sit down for lunch, with amusement park rides also available for both children and adults. Since the Taliban takeover in 2021 and severe economic sanctions placed on the government, the once popular attraction has seen visitor numbers drastically reduced. ",

The shrine was first built in the 12th century, but was later destroyed or concealed during Genghis Khan’s invasion of the area. The mosque we know today was built on top of Ali’s tomb and completed in the late 15th century. Sunnis every year make a pilgrimage to the site during the Nowruz festival.",
